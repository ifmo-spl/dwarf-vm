/** @def FOR_BYTECODES(DO)
 * Instruction descriptions.
 *
 * TOS = top of the stack
 * 
 * Each entry is a triple of bytecode mnemonic, description and the instruction
 * length in bytes.  All instructions except DUMP are consuming stack operands. 
 * For "binary" instructions the second operand is on top of the stack, e.g.:
 *    ```
 *    LOAD 2
 *    LOAD 1
 *    ISUB
 *    ```
 *    will, as the result, place 1 on TOS (not -1)
 *
 *
 * The command system was inspired by `mathvm` (author: Nikolai Igotti), an
 * educational virtual machine project proposed to Academic University students
 * in St.-Petersburg, Russia.
